- Created by Guido Van Rossum in the early 1990s
- Python 3
- Interpreted language - Interpreter receives a command, evaluates it, and then reports the result of the command. Compilation doesn’t happen.
- `.py` suffix for python files
- Syntax relies on whitespaces and indentations
- Comments - `# this is a comment`

### Objects in Python

- Object oriented language and classes form the basis of all types

##### Identifiers, objects and assignment statements

- Identifiers - Variables in other languages
- temperature = 98.6
- Temperature is the identifier
- Mapped to object(98.6)
- Case sensitive, can’t begin with a number
- Similar to a pointer in C
- Associated with the memory address of the object which it refers
- Can be assigned to `None` object(similar to `null` in JS)
- Dynamically typed(unlike java/C++) - no advance association of identifier with a data type
- Objects on the other hand, have a definite type (98.6 is float)
- Alias - associating another identifier to existing object (`temp = 98.6`. Temp and temperature both point to 98.6 now)
- Assignment by reference, so changes to one alias reflect in the next
- Although if assignment done again via = operator, the alias breaks 
- Ex - `temperature = temperature + 5` 
- New values: Temp -> 98.6, and temperature -> 103.6

##### Creating and using objects

- Instantiation - process of creating a new instance
- By invoking the constructor of the class (Widget() for class Widget)
- Or by literal form (temp = 98.6 for floats, “98.6” new instance of the float )
- Or functions which return a new instance of a class (for ex- `sorted()`)
- Syntax for calling methods - either use sorted(data) (where data is passed as a param) or `data.sorted()` (member functions) 
- Accessors - similar to getters 
- Mutators - similar to setters

##### Python’s built-In classes

- Immutable classes - classes whose values are fixed upon instantiation and cannot be changed subsequently. Ex- float
- `Bool, int, float, list, tuple, str, set, frozenset, dict`
- Most of them support literal forms of initialization(like 98.6) and all of them support traditional constructors
- Bool Class
  - Takes values True or False
  - Default constructor : bool() - returns False
  - `bool(string)` - returns False if empty
  - `bool(number)` - returns False if 0
- Int Class
  - Numeric type
  - Chooses internal representations according to the magnitude of the value
  -  Default constructor - `int()` returns 0
     - Can also be used to typecast from other types
     - “3” will be converted to 3, if passed as param to int
     - For base conversion, use int(num, base) ( ex- `int(‘7f’, 16)` evaluates to 127)
- Float class
  - Floating point, fixed precision representation
  - Precision like double in java/c++
  - Default constructor - float() returns 0.0
    - “3.14” will change to 3.14 float value
- Sequence types: list, tuple, and string
  - Collection of values where order is significant
  - No concept of char type(like java/c++), ‘c’ is just string with length 1
- List Class
  - Stores sequence of objects
  - Referential structure - stores a sequence of references to its elements
  - Can have different types of objects - [1, ‘two’, None] is a valid list
  - Zero indexed, and are like arrays
  - Can dynamically increase and decrease in size
  - `[]` - empty list
  - Constructor `list()` - produces empty list
    - `list(‘hello’)` - produces `[‘h’,’e’,’l’,’l’,’o’]`
- Tuple class
  - Immutable sequence
  - `()` - empty tuple
  - One element tuple - `(17,)` [because (17) will be taken as a paranthesized numeric expression]
- Str class
	- Immutable sequence of characters
	- Unicode
	- Supports both single and double quotes
	- Use backslash to escape
	- Triple quotes can be used for multiline strings, no need to escape newlines
	- “Hello”, ‘hello’, ‘’’hello’’’, “””hello””” - all are valid strings
- Set and frozenset class
  - Collection of elements, without duplicates, and without order
	- Based on hash tables
	- O(1) lookups for finding membership of keys
	- No order maintained
	- Only immutable types can be added to set
		- Set of sets and set of lists are not allowed
	- Frozenset - immutable form of set class
	- {17}, {‘red’, ‘green’, ‘blue’} are valid sets
	- `{}` - does not represent empty set, but represents an empty dictionary(historical reasons)
	- Default constructor - `set()` produces an empty set, expects an iterable as input
	- `set('hello')` produces `set(['h', 'e', 'l', 'o'])`
- Dict class
	- Represents dictionary/mapping, key to value map
	- `{}` - represents empty dictionary
	- `{‘a’:1, ‘b’:2}` - valid dictionary
	- dict(pairs) with `pairs = [( ga , Irish ), ( de , German )]` can be used to generate dict

##### Expressions, operators, and precedence
- Logical operators
	- `not, and, or`
	- `and` and `or` operators short circuit
- Equality operators
	- ` is ` same identity
	- 	Evaluates to True only if a and b are aliases for the same object 
	- ` is not `  different identity 
	-  ` == `  equivalent
		- Gives true for different objects with values that are deemed equivalent
	- ` != ` not equivalent
- Comparison operators
	- ` < , > , <= , >= `
- Arithmetic operators
	- ` +, -, *, /, //, % `
	- / - true division
	- // - integer division
	- Python supports the pair of operators // and % to perform the integral calculations, with expression ` 27 // 4 ` evaluating to int value 6 (the mathematical floor of the quotient), and expression ` 27 % 4 ` evaluating to int value 3, the remainder of the integer division
- Bitwise operators
